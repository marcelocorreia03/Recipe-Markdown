**Recipe:**
1. Fill a bowl with warm water and place cold eggs into the bowl, to keep from cracking when you cook them.
2. Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water; add salt. Microwave on high power to boil, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
3. Place warm eggs into the bowl of hot water and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
4. Place the bowl of covered eggs into the microwave and microwave on 60% power for 1 1/2 minutes.
5. Remove from the microwave and transfer eggs to a bowl of cool water to stop the cooking process. Peel and serve.
